.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\-cask\fR \- a friendly binary installer for macOS
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew cask\fR command [options] [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew\-Cask is a tool for installing precompiled macOS binaries (such as Applications) from the command line\. The user is never required to use the graphical user interface\.
.
.SH "ALPHA\-QUALITY SOFTWARE"
Homebrew\-Cask works robustly enough that we welcome new users, but the project is still in early development\. That means command names, option names, and other aspects of this manual are still subject to change\.
.
.SH "FREQUENTLY USED COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR [\-\-force] [\-\-skip\-cask\-deps] [\-\-require\-sha] [\-\-language=\fIiso\-language\fR[,\fIiso\-language\fR \.\.\. ]] \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Install Cask identified by \fItoken\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBuninstall\fR [\-\-force] \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]

.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR | /\fIregexp\fR/
Perform a substring search of known Cask tokens for \fItext\fR\. If the text is delimited by slashes, it is interpreted as a Ruby regular expression\.

If \fB\-\-greedy\fR is given then also include in the output the Casks having \fBauto_updates true\fR or \fBversion :latest\fR\. Otherwise they are skipped because there is no reliable way to know when updates are available for them\.

.SH "INTERACTION WITH HOMEBREW"
Homebrew\-Cask is implemented as a external command for Homebrew\. That means this project is entirely built upon the Homebrew infrastructure\. For example, upgrades to the Homebrew\-Cask tool are received through Homebrew:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

brew update; brew cask upgrade; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
And updates to individual Cask definitions are received whenever you issue the Homebrew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

brew update
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "OTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK"
Most Homebrew\-Cask commands can accept a Cask token as an argument\. As described above, the argument can take the form of:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A token as returned by \fBbrew cask search\fR, e\.g\. \fBgoogle\-chrome\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Homebrew\-Cask also accepts three other forms in place of plain tokens:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A fully\-qualified token which includes the Tap name, e\.g\. \fBcaskroom/fonts/font\-symbola\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A fully\-qualified pathname to a Cask file, e\.g\. \fB/usr/local/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/Casks/google\-chrome\.rb\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \fBcurl\fR\-retrievable URI to a Cask file, e\.g\. \fBhttps://raw\.githubusercontent\.com/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/f25b6babcd398abf48e33af3d887b2d00de1d661/Casks/google\-chrome\.rb\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Homebrew\-Cask respects many of the environment variables used by the parent command \fBbrew\fR\. Please refer to the \fBbrew\fR(1) man page for more information\.
.
.P
Environment variables specific to Homebrew\-Cask:
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS\fR
This variable may contain any arguments normally used as options on the command\-line\. This is particularly useful to make options persistent\. For example, you might add to your \.bash_profile or \.zshenv something like:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

       export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=\'\-\-appdir=~/Applications \-\-fontdir=/Library/Fonts\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.
.P
Other environment variables:
.
.TP
\fBSUDO_ASKPASS\fR
When this variable is set, Homebrew\-Cask will call \fBsudo\fR(8) with the \fB\-A\fR option\.
.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.P
The Homebrew\-Cask GitHub page: \fIhttps://github\.com/caskroom/homebrew\-cask\fR

.SH "AUTHORS"

.
.P

.
.SH "BUGS"
We still have bugs \- and we are busy fixing them! If you have a problem, don\'t be shy about reporting it on our GitHub issues page \fIhttps://github\.com/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/issues?state=open\fR\.
.
.P
When reporting bugs, remember that Homebrew\-Cask is an independent project from Homebrew\. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project\. If your command\-line started with \fBbrew cask\fR, bring the bug to us first!
