\fBtap\fR [\fB\-\-full\fR] [\fB\-\-force\-auto\-update\fR] \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR [\fIURL\fR]
Tap a formula repository\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBbrew tap\fR \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR \fBhttps://github\.com/\fR\fIuser\fR\fB/homebrew\-\fR\fIrepo\fR\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.IP
By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR), but if \fB\-\-full\fR is passed, a full clone will be used\. To convert a shallow copy to a full copy, you can retap passing \fB\-\-full\fR without first untapping\.
.
.IP
By default, only taps hosted on GitHub are auto\-updated (for performance reasons)\. If \fB\-\-force\-auto\-update\fR is passed, this tap will be auto\-updated even if it is not hosted on GitHub\.
.
.IP
\fBtap\fR is re\-runnable and exits successfully if there\'s nothing to do\. However, retapping with a different \fIURL\fR will cause an exception, so first \fBuntap\fR if you need to modify the \fIURL\fR\.

.SH "CUSTOM EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the \fBPATH\fR, named \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR or \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR\fB\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew\fR \fIcmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew\'s internals\.
.
.P
Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://docs\.brew\.sh/External\-Commands\fR
.
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBhomebrew/core\fR\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary file or URL
Homebrew can install formulae via URL, e\.g\. \fBhttps://raw\.githubusercontent\.com/Homebrew/homebrew\-core/master/Formula/git\.rb\fR, or from a local path\. It could point to either a formula file or a bottle\. In the case of a URL, the downloaded file will be cached for later use\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected\. For example, \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1\fR rather than just \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to prefix all download URLs, including those for bottles, with this variable\. For example, \fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080\fR will cause a formula with the URL \fBhttps://example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR to instead download from \fBhttp://localhost:8080/example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS\fR
If set, Homebrew will only check for autoupdates once per this seconds interval\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR \fB60\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\fR
When using the \fBS3\fR download strategy, Homebrew will look in these variables for access credentials (see \fIhttps://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli\-chap\-getting\-started\.html#cli\-environment\fR to retrieve these access credentials from AWS)\. If they are not set, the \fBS3\fR download strategy will download with a public (unsigned) URL\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN\fR
By default, Homebrew uses \fBhttps://homebrew\.bintray\.com/\fR as its download mirror for bottles\. If set, instructs Homebrew to instead use the specified URL\. For example, \fBHOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080\fR will cause all bottles to download from the prefix \fBhttp://localhost:8080/\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BROWSER\fR
If set, Homebrew uses this setting as the browser when opening project homepages, instead of the OS default browser\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CACHE\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the specified directory as the download cache\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR \fB~/Library/Caches/Homebrew\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CURLRC\fR
If set, Homebrew will not pass \fB\-q\fR when invoking \fBcurl\fR(1) (which disables the use of \fBcurlrc\fR)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CURL_VERBOSE\fR
If set, Homebrew will pass \fB\-\-verbose\fR when invoking \fBcurl\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG\fR
If set, any commands that can emit debugging information will do so\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEVELOPER\fR
If set, Homebrew will tweak behaviour to be more relevant for Homebrew developers (active or budding), e\.g\. turning warnings into errors\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_EDITOR\fR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same directory\.
.
.IP
\fINote:\fR \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and directories\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL\fR
If set, Homebrew will always use a Homebrew\-installed \fBcurl\fR rather than the system version\. Automatically set if the system version of \fBcurl\fR is too old\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_FORCE_VENDOR_RUBY\fR
If set, Homebrew will always use its vendored, relocatable Ruby version even if the system version of Ruby is new enough\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_GIT\fR
If set, Homebrew will always use a Homebrew\-installed \fBgit\fR rather than the system version\. Automatically set if the system version of \fBgit\fR is too old\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN\fR
A personal access token for the GitHub API, used by Homebrew for features such as \fBbrew search\fR\. You can create one at \fIhttps://github\.com/settings/tokens\fR\. If set, GitHub will allow you a greater number of API requests\. For more information, see: \fIhttps://developer\.github\.com/v3/#rate\-limiting\fR
.
.IP
\fINote:\fR Homebrew doesn\'t require permissions for any of the scopes\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE\fR
Text printed before the installation summary of each successful build\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR the beer emoji\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_CLEANUP\fR
If set, \fBbrew install\fR, \fBbrew upgrade\fR and \fBbrew reinstall\fR will remove previously installed version(s) of the installed/upgraded formulae\.
.
.IP
If \fBbrew cleanup\fR has not been run in 30 days then it will be run at this time\.
.
.IP
This will become the default in a later version of Homebrew\. To opt\-out see \fBHOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_LOGS\fR
If set, Homebrew will use the specified directory to store log files\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the value of \fBHOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS\fR as the number of parallel jobs to run when building with \fBmake\fR(1)\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR the number of available CPU cores\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS\fR
If set, Homebrew will not send analytics\. See: \fIhttps://docs\.brew\.sh/Analytics\fR
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE\fR
If set, Homebrew will not auto\-update before running \fBbrew install\fR, \fBbrew upgrade\fR or \fBbrew tap\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_BOTTLE_SOURCE_FALLBACK\fR
If set, Homebrew will fail on the failure of installation from a bottle rather than falling back to building from source\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_COLOR\fR
If set, Homebrew will not print text with color added\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_EMOJI\fR
If set, Homebrew will not print the \fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE\fR on a successful build\.
.
.IP
\fINote:\fR Homebrew will only try to print emoji on OS X Lion or newer\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fR
If set, Homebrew will not permit redirects from secure HTTPS to insecure HTTP\.
.
.IP
While ensuring your downloads are fully secure, this is likely to cause from\-source SourceForge, some GNU & GNOME based formulae to fail to download\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API\fR
If set, Homebrew will not use the GitHub API, e\.g\. for searches or fetching relevant issues on a failed install\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP\fR
If set, \fBbrew install\fR, \fBbrew upgrade\fR and \fBbrew reinstall\fR will never automatically remove the previously installed version(s) of the installed/upgraded formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_PRY\fR
If set, Homebrew will use Pry for the \fBbrew irb\fR command\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular \fBsvn\fR binary\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew prefix are on different volumes, as macOS has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_UPDATE_TO_TAG\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to always use the latest stable tag (even if developer commands have been run)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_VERBOSE\fR
If set, Homebrew always assumes \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
\fBhttp_proxy\fR
Sets the HTTP proxy to be used by \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR and \fBsvn\fR when downloading through Homebrew\.
.
.TP
\fBhttps_proxy\fR
Sets the HTTPS proxy to be used by \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR and \fBsvn\fR when downloading through Homebrew\.
.
.TP
\fBall_proxy\fR
Sets the SOCKS5 proxy to be used by \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR and \fBsvn\fR when downloading through Homebrew\.
.
.TP
\fBftp_proxy\fR
Sets the FTP proxy to be used by \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR and \fBsvn\fR when downloading through Homebrew\.
.
.TP
\fBno_proxy\fR
Sets the comma\-separated list of hostnames and domain names that should be excluded from proxying by \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR and \fBsvn\fR when downloading through Homebrew\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Set the \fBhttp_proxy\fR, \fBhttps_proxy\fR, \fBall_proxy\fR, \fBftp_proxy\fR and/or \fBno_proxy\fR environment variables documented above\.
