Search both name and description (\fB\-s\fR), just the names (\fB\-n\fR), or just the descriptions (\fB\-d\fR) for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression\. Formula descriptions are cached; the cache is created on the first search, making that search slower than subsequent ones\.
.
.TP
\fBdiy\fR [\fB\-\-name=\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB\-\-version=\fR\fIversion\fR]
Automatically determine the installation prefix for non\-Homebrew software\.

.
.IP
\fIformula\fR is usually the name of the formula to install, but it can be specified in several different ways\. See \fISPECIFYING FORMULAE\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-debug\fR (or \fB\-d\fR) is passed and brewing fails, open an interactive debugging session with access to IRB or a shell inside the temporary build directory\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-env=std\fR is passed, use the standard build environment instead of superenv\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-env=super\fR is passed, use superenv even if the formula specifies the standard build environment\.

.IP
If \fB\-\-ignore\-dependencies\fR is passed, skip installing any dependencies of any kind\. If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail to install\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-only\-dependencies\fR is passed, install the dependencies with specified options but do not install the specified formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-cc=\fR\fIcompiler\fR is passed, attempt to compile using \fIcompiler\fR\. \fIcompiler\fR should be the name of the compiler\'s executable, for instance \fBgcc\-4\.2\fR for Apple\'s GCC 4\.2, or \fBgcc\-4\.9\fR for a Homebrew\-provided GCC 4\.9\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-build\-from\-source\fR (or \fB\-s\fR) is passed, compile the specified \fIformula\fR from source even if a bottle is provided\. Dependencies will still be installed from bottles if they are available\.
.
.IP
If \fBHOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\fR is set, regardless of whether \fB\-\-build\-from\-source\fR was passed, then both \fIformula\fR and the dependencies installed as part of this process are built from source even if bottles are available\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\-bottle\fR is passed, install from a bottle if it exists for the current or newest version of macOS, even if it would not normally be used for installation\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-devel\fR is passed, and \fIformula\fR defines it, install the development version\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, and \fIformula\fR defines it, install the HEAD version, aka master, trunk, unstable\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-keep\-tmp\fR is passed, the temporary files created during installation are not deleted\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-build\-bottle\fR is passed, prepare the formula for eventual bottling during installation\.
.
.IP
Installation options specific to \fIformula\fR may be appended to the command, and can be listed with \fBbrew options\fR \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR \fB\-\-interactive\fR [\fB\-\-git\fR] \fIformula\fR
If \fB\-\-interactive\fR (or \fB\-i\fR) is passed, download and patch \fIformula\fR, then open a shell\. This allows the user to run \fB\./configure \-\-help\fR and otherwise determine how to turn the software package into a Homebrew formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-git\fR (or \fB\-g\fR) is passed, Homebrew will create a Git repository, useful for creating patches to the software\.
.
.TP
\fBirb\fR [\fB\-\-examples\fR]
Enter the interactive Homebrew Ruby shell\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-examples\fR is passed, several examples will be shown\.

.
.TP
\fBln\fR, \fBlink\fR [\fB\-\-overwrite\fR] [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR] \fIformula\fR
Symlink all of \fIformula\fR\'s installed files into the Homebrew prefix\. This is done automatically when you install formulae but can be useful for DIY installations\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-overwrite\fR is passed, Homebrew will delete files which already exist in the prefix while linking\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR or \fB\-n\fR is passed, Homebrew will list all files which would be linked or which would be deleted by \fBbrew link \-\-overwrite\fR, but will not actually link or delete any files\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR (or \fB\-f\fR) is passed, Homebrew will allow keg\-only formulae to be linked\.
.
.TP
\fBlinkapps\fR [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fIformulae\fR]
Find installed formulae that provide \fB\.app\fR\-style macOS apps and symlink them into \fB/Applications\fR, allowing for easier access (deprecated)\.
.
.IP
Unfortunately \fBbrew linkapps\fR cannot behave nicely with e\.g\. Spotlight using either aliases or symlinks and Homebrew formulae do not build "proper" \fB\.app\fR bundles that can be relocated\. Instead, please consider using \fBbrew cask\fR and migrate formulae using \fB\.app\fRs to casks\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them will have their apps symlinked\.
.
.IP
If provided, \fB\-\-local\fR will symlink them into the user\'s \fB~/Applications\fR directory instead of the system directory\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR, \fBls\fR [\fB\-\-full\-name\fR]
List all installed formulae\. If \fB\-\-full\-name\fR is passed, print formulae with fully\-qualified names\. If \fB\-\-full\-name\fR is not passed, any other options (e\.g\. \fB\-t\fR) are passed to \fBls\fR which produces the actual output\.

.
.IP
If \fB\-\-pinned\fR is passed, show the versions of pinned formulae, or only the specified (pinned) formulae if \fIformulae\fR are given\. See also \fBpin\fR, \fBunpin\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBlog\fR [\fIgit\-log\-options\fR] \fIformula\fR \.\.\.
Show the git log for the given formulae\. Options that \fBgit\-log\fR(1) recognizes can be passed before the formula list\.
.
.TP
\fBmigrate\fR [\fB\-\-force\fR] \fIformulae\fR
Migrate renamed packages to new name, where \fIformulae\fR are old names of packages\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR (or \fB\-f\fR) is passed, then treat installed \fIformulae\fR and passed \fIformulae\fR like if they are from same taps and migrate them anyway\.
.
.TP
\fBmissing\fR [\fB\-\-hide=\fR\fIhidden\fR] [\fIformulae\fR]
Check the given \fIformulae\fR for missing dependencies\. If no \fIformulae\fR are given, check all installed brews\.

Rerun the post\-install steps for \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBprune\fR [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR]
Remove dead symlinks from the Homebrew prefix\. This is generally not needed, but can be useful when doing DIY installations\. Also remove broken app symlinks from \fB/Applications\fR and \fB~/Applications\fR that were previously created by \fBbrew linkapps\fR\.
.

\fBsearch\fR [\fB\-\-desc\fR] (\fItext\fR|\fB/\fR\fItext\fR\fB/\fR)
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to some popular taps\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-desc\fR is passed, browse available packages matching \fItext\fR including a description for each\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR (\fB\-\-debian\fR|\fB\-\-fedora\fR|\fB\-\-fink\fR|\fB\-\-macports\fR|\fB\-\-opensuse\fR|\fB\-\-ubuntu\fR) \fItext\fR
Search for \fItext\fR in the given package manager\'s list\.
.
.TP
\fBsh\fR [\fB\-\-env=std\fR]
Start a Homebrew build environment shell\. Uses our years\-battle\-hardened Homebrew build logic to help your \fB\./configure && make && make install\fR or even your \fBgem install\fR succeed\. Especially handy if you run Homebrew in an Xcode\-only configuration since it adds tools like \fBmake\fR to your \fBPATH\fR which otherwise build systems would not find\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-env=std\fR is passed, use the standard \fBPATH\fR instead of superenv\'s\.
.
.TP
\fBstyle\fR [\fB\-\-fix\fR] [\fB\-\-display\-cop\-names\fR] [\fB\-\-only\-cops=\fR[COP1,COP2\.\.]|\fB\-\-except\-cops=\fR[COP1,COP2\.\.]] [\fIfiles\fR|\fItaps\fR|\fIformulae\fR]
Check formulae or files for conformance to Homebrew style guidelines\.
.
.IP
\fIformulae\fR and \fIfiles\fR may not be combined\. If both are omitted, style will run style checks on the whole Homebrew \fBLibrary\fR, including core code and all formulae\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-fix\fR is passed, style violations will be automatically fixed using RuboCop\'s \fB\-\-auto\-correct\fR feature\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-display\-cop\-names\fR is passed, the RuboCop cop name for each violation is included in the output\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-only\-cops\fR is passed, only the given Rubocop cop(s)\' violations would be checked\.

.
.TP
\fBtap\fR [\fB\-\-full\fR] \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR [\fIURL\fR]
Tap a formula repository\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBtap <user>/<repo> https://github\.com/<user>/homebrew\-<repo>\fR\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.IP
By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR), but if \fB\-\-full\fR is passed, a full clone will be used\. To convert a shallow copy to a full copy, you can retap passing \fB\-\-full\fR without first untapping\.
.
.IP
\fBtap\fR is re\-runnable and exits successfully if there\'s nothing to do\. However, retapping with a different \fIURL\fR will cause an exception, so first \fBuntap\fR if you need to modify the \fIURL\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBtap\fR \fB\-\-repair\fR
Migrate tapped formulae from symlink\-based to directory\-based structure\.

Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR (or \fB\-f\fR) is passed, and there are multiple versions of \fIformula\fR installed, delete all installed versions\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-ignore\-dependencies\fR is passed, uninstalling won\'t fail, even if formulae depending on \fIformula\fR would still be installed\.
.
.TP
\fBunlink\fR [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR] \fIformula\fR
Remove symlinks for \fIformula\fR from the Homebrew prefix\. This can be useful for temporarily disabling a formula: \fBbrew unlink <formula> && <commands> && brew link <formula>\fR
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR or \fB\-n\fR is passed, Homebrew will list all files which would be unlinked, but will not actually unlink or delete any files\.

.
.IP
While ensuring your downloads are fully secure, this is likely to cause from\-source SourceForge, some GNU & GNOME based formulae to fail to download\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API\fR
If set, Homebrew will not use the GitHub API for e\.g searches or fetching relevant issues on a failed install\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE\fR
Text printed before the installation summary of each successful build\. Defaults to the beer emoji\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular \fBsvn\fR binary\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as macOS has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_VERBOSE\fR
If set, Homebrew always assumes \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR, \fBsvn\fR)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
