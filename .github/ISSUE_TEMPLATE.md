If Homebrew was updated on Aug 10-11th 2016 and `brew update` always says `Already up-to-date.` you need to run: `cd "$(brew --repo)" && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master && brew update`.

# Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

- [ ] Ran `brew update` and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Ran `brew doctor`, fixed as many issues as possible and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Confirmed this is a problem with Homebrew/brew and not specific formulae? If it's a formulae-specific problem please file this issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new
