# New Maintainer Checklist

**This is a guide used by existing maintainers to invite new maintainers. You might find it interesting but there's nothing here users should have to know.**

So, there's someone who has been making consistently high-quality contributions to Homebrew for a long time and shown themselves able to make slightly more advanced contributions than just e.g. formula updates? Let's invite them to be a maintainer!

First, send them the invitation email:

```
The Homebrew team and I really appreciate your help on issues, pull requests and
your contributions around $THEIR_CONTRIBUTIONS.

We would like to invite you to have commit access. There are no obligations,
but we'd appreciate your continuing help in keeping on top of contributions.

A few requests:

- please make pull requests on any changes to Homebrew/brew code or any
  non-trivial (e.g. not a test or audit improvement or version bump) changes
  to formulae code and don't merge them unless you get at least one approval
  and passing tests.
- use `brew pull` for formulae changes that require new bottles or change
  multiple formulae and let it auto-close issues wherever possible (it may
  take ~5m). When this isn't necessary use GitHub's "Merge pull request"
  button in "create a merge commit" mode for Homebrew/brew or "squash and
  merge" for a single formulae change. If in doubt, check with e.g. GitX that
  you've not accidentally added merge commits
- still create your branches on your fork rather than in the main repository
- if still in doubt please ask for help and we'll help you out - these are
  probably worth a read:
    - https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Brew-Test-Bot-For-Core-Contributors.md
    - https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Maintainer-Guidelines.md
    - possibly everything else in the documentation

How does that sound?

Thanks for all your work so far!
```

If they accept, follow a few steps to get them set up:

- Invite them to the [**@Homebrew/maintainers** team](https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/teams/maintainers) to give them write access to all repositories (but don't make them owners yet). They will need to enable [GitHub's Two Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).
- Ask them to sign in to [Bintray](https://bintray.com) using their GitHub account and they should auto-sync to [Bintray's Homebrew organisation](https://bintray.com/homebrew/organization/edit/members) as a member so they can publish new bottles
- Add them to the [Jenkins' GitHub Authorization Settings admin user names](https://bot.brew.sh/configureSecurity/) so they can adjust settings and restart jobs
- Add them to the [Jenkins' GitHub Pull Request Builder admin list](https://bot.brew.sh/configure) to enable `@BrewTestBot test this please` for them
- Invite them to the [`homebrew-dev` private maintainers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/homebrew-dev/invite)
- Invite them to the [`machomebrew` private maintainers Slack](https://machomebrew.slack.com/admin/invites)
- Invite them to the [`homebrew` private maintainers 1Password](https://homebrew.1password.com/signin)
- Add them to [Homebrew's README](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/edit/master/README.md)

After a few weeks/months with no problems consider making them [owners on the Homebrew GitHub organisation](https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/people).

Now sit back, relax and let the new maintainers handle more of our contributions.
