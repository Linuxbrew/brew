# Interesting Taps & Forks

A [tap](Taps.md) is Homebrew-speak for a Git repository containing extra formulae.
Homebrew has the capability to add (and remove) multiple taps to your local installation with the `brew tap` and `brew untap` commands. Type `man brew` in your terminal. The main repository at <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core>, often called `homebrew/core`, is always built-in.

Your taps are Git repositories located at `$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps`.
