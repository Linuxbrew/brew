# Interesting Taps & Forks

A _tap_ is homebrew-speak for a Git repository containing extra formulae.
Homebrew has the capability to add (and remove) multiple taps to your local installation with the `brew tap` and `brew untap` commands. Type `man brew` in your Terminal. The main repository [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core), often called `homebrew/core`, is always built-in.

Your taps are Git repositories located at `$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps`.
