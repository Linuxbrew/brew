# Contributing to Cadfaelbrew
[Cadfaelbrew](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/brew) is a fork of [Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew). Linuxbrew is merged into Cadfaelbrew roughly once per month. To contribute a new formula or a new version of an existing formula, please submit your pull request to our [dedicated tap](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/homebrew-cadfael)

Patches to fix issues particular to Linux should not affect the behaviour of the formula on Mac. Use `if OS.mac?` and `if OS.linux?` as necessary to preserve the existing behaviour on Mac.

### Report a bug

* run `brew update` (twice)
* run and read `brew doctor`
* read [the Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting)
* open an issue on the formula's repository or on Linuxbrew/brew if it's not a formula-specific issue

### Propose a feature
