brew-cask(1) - a friendly binary installer for macOS
====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`brew cask` command [options] [ <token> ... ]

## DESCRIPTION

Homebrew-Cask is a tool for installing precompiled macOS binaries (such as
Applications) from the command line. The user is never required to use the
graphical user interface.

## ALPHA-QUALITY SOFTWARE

Homebrew-Cask works robustly enough that we welcome new users, but the
project is still in early development. That means command names, option
names, and other aspects of this manual are still subject to change.

## FREQUENTLY USED COMMANDS

  * `install` [--force] [--skip-cask-deps] [--require-sha] [--language=<iso-language>[,<iso-language> ... ]] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Install Cask identified by <token>.

  * `uninstall` [--force] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Uninstall Cask identified by <token>.

  * `search` <text> | /<regexp>/:
    Perform a substring search of known Cask tokens for <text>. If the text
    is delimited by slashes, it is interpreted as a Ruby regular expression.

    The tokens returned by `search` are suitable as arguments for most other
    commands, such as `install` or `uninstall`.

## COMMANDS

  * `audit` [--language=<iso-language>[,<iso-language> ... ]] [ <token> ... ]:
    Check the given Casks for installability.
    If no tokens are given on the command line, all Casks are audited.

  * `cat` <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Dump the given Cask definition file to the standard output.

  * `cleanup` [--outdated]:
    Clean up cached downloads and tracker symlinks. With `--outdated`,
    only clean up cached downloads older than 10 days old.

  * `create` <token>:
    Generate a Cask definition file for the Cask identified by <token>
    and open a template for it in your favorite editor.

  * `doctor` or `dr`:
    Check for configuration issues. Can be useful to upload as a gist for
    developers along with a bug report.

  * `edit` <token>:
    Open the given Cask definition file for editing.

  * `fetch` [--force] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Download remote application files for the given Cask to the local
    cache. With `--force`, force re-download even if the files are already
    cached.

  * `home` or `homepage` [ <token> ... ]:
    Display the homepage associated with a given Cask in a browser.

    With no arguments, display the project page <https://caskroom.github.io/>.

  * `info` or `abv` <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Display information about the given Cask.

  * `install` [--force] [--skip-cask-deps] [--require-sha] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Install the given Cask. With `--force`, re-install even if the Cask
    appears to be already present. With `--skip-cask-deps`, skip any Cask
    dependencies. `--require-sha` will abort installation if the Cask does not
    have a checksum defined.

    <token> is usually the ID of a Cask as returned by `brew cask search`,
    but see [OTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK][] for variations.

  * `list` or `ls` [-1] [--versions] [ <token> ... ]:
    Without any arguments, list all installed Casks. With `-1`, always
    format the output in a single column. With `--versions`, show all installed
    versions.

    If <token> is given, summarize the staged files associated with the
    given Cask.

  * `outdated` [--greedy] [--verbose|--quiet] [ <token> ... ]:
    Without token arguments, display all the installed Casks that have newer
    versions available in the tap; otherwise check only the tokens given
    in the command line.
    If `--greedy` is given then also include in the output the Casks having
    `auto_updates true` or `version :latest`. Otherwise they are skipped
    because there is no reliable way to know when updates are available for
    them.<br>
    `--verbose` forces the display of the outdated and latest version.<br>
    `--quiet` suppresses the display of versions.

  * `reinstall` <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Reinstall the given Cask.

  * `search` or `-S` [<text> | /<regexp>/]:
    Without an argument, display all locally available Casks for install; no
    online search is performed.
    Otherwise perform a substring search of known Cask tokens for <text> or,
    if the text is delimited by slashes (/<regexp>/), it is interpreted as a
    Ruby regular expression.

  * `style` [--fix] [ <token> ... ]:
    Check the given Casks for correct style using [RuboCop Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/rubocop-cask).
    If no tokens are given on the command line, all Casks are checked.
    With `--fix`, auto-correct any style errors if possible.

  * `uninstall` or `rm` or `remove` [--force] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Uninstall the given Cask. With `--force`, uninstall even if the Cask
    does not appear to be present.

  * `upgrade` [--force] [--greedy] <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Without token arguments, upgrade all the installed Casks that have newer
    versions available in the tap; otherwise update the tokens given
    in the command line.
    If `--greedy` is given then also upgrade the Casks having `auto_updates true`
    or `version :latest`.

  * `zap` <token> [ <token> ... ]:
    Unconditionally remove _all_ files associated with the given Cask.

    Implicitly performs all actions associated with `uninstall`, even if
    the Cask does not appear to be currently installed.

    Removes all staged versions of the Cask distribution found under
    `<Caskroom_path>/`<token>.

    If the Cask definition contains a `zap` stanza, performs additional
    `zap` actions as defined there, such as removing local preference
    files. `zap` actions are variable, depending on the level of detail
    defined by the Cask author.

    **`zap` may remove files which are shared between applications.**

## INTERNAL COMMANDS

  * `_appcast_checkpoint` [--calculate] [ <token> ... | <URL> ... ]:
    Given a <token>, returns the current appcast checkpoint, or calculates
    the appcast checkpoint if the `--calculate` flag is specified.

    Given a <URL>, calculates the appcast checkpoint for it.

  * `_stanza` <stanza_name> [ --table | --yaml | --inspect | --quiet ] [ <token> ... ]:
    Given a <stanza_name> and a <token>, returns the current stanza for a
    given Cask. If no <token> is given, then data for all Casks is returned.

## INTERACTION WITH HOMEBREW

Homebrew-Cask is implemented as a external command for Homebrew. That means
this project is entirely built upon the Homebrew infrastructure. For
example, upgrades to the Homebrew-Cask tool are received through Homebrew:

    brew update; brew cask upgrade; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup

And updates to individual Cask definitions are received whenever you issue
the Homebrew command:

    brew update

## OTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK

Most Homebrew-Cask commands can accept a Cask token as an argument. As
described above, the argument can take the form of:

  * A token as returned by `brew cask search`, e.g. `google-chrome`

Homebrew-Cask also accepts three other forms in place of plain tokens:

  * A fully-qualified token which includes the Tap name, e.g.
    `caskroom/fonts/font-symbola`

  * A fully-qualified pathname to a Cask file, e.g.
    `/usr/local/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-cask/Casks/google-chrome.rb`

  * A `curl`-retrievable URI to a Cask file, e.g.
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/f25b6babcd398abf48e33af3d887b2d00de1d661/Casks/google-chrome.rb`

## ENVIRONMENT

Homebrew-Cask respects many of the environment variables used by the
parent command `brew`. Please refer to the `brew`(1) man page for more
information.

Environment variables specific to Homebrew-Cask:

  * `HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS`:
    This variable may contain any arguments normally used as options on
    the command-line. This is particularly useful to make options persistent.
    For example, you might add to your .bash_profile or .zshenv something like:

               export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS='--appdir=~/Applications --fontdir=/Library/Fonts'

Other environment variables:

  * `SUDO_ASKPASS`:
    When this variable is set, Homebrew-Cask will call `sudo`(8) with the `-A` option.
