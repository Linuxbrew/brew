#:  * `cleanup` [`--prune=`<days>] [`--dry-run`] [`-s`] [<formulae>]:
#:    For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the
#:    cellar. In addition, old downloads from the Homebrew download-cache are deleted.
#:
#:    If `--prune=`<days> is specified, remove all cache files older than <days>.
#:
#:    If `--dry-run` or `-n` is passed, show what would be removed, but do not
#:    actually remove anything.
#:
#:    If `-s` is passed, scrub the cache, removing downloads for even the latest
#:    versions of formulae. Note downloads for any installed formulae will still not be
#:    deleted. If you want to delete those too: `rm -rf $(brew --cache)`
