# Caveats DSL. Each method should handle output, following the
# convention of at least one trailing blank line so that the user
# can distinguish separate caveats.

# ( The return value of the last method in the block is also sent
#   to the output by the caller, but that feature is only for the
#   convenience of Cask authors. )

          to your PATH environment variable, eg (for bash shell):

          To use #{@cask}, zsh users may need to add the following line to their
          ~/.zprofile.  (Among other effects, #{path} will be added to the
          PATH environment variable):

          Cask #{@cask} installs files under /usr/local. The presence of such
          files can cause warnings when running "brew doctor", which is considered
          to be a bug in Homebrew-Cask.
