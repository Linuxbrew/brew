# A formula provides instructions and metadata for Homebrew to install a piece
# of software. Every Homebrew formula is a {Formula}.
# All subclasses of {Formula} (and all Ruby classes) have to be named
# `UpperCase` and `not-use-dashes`.
# A formula specified in `this-formula.rb` should have a class named
# `ThisFormula`. Homebrew does enforce that the name of the file and the class
# correspond.
# Make sure you check with `brew search` that the name is free!
