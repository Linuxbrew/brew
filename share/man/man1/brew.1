If \fB\-\-full\-name\fR is passed, list dependencies by their full name\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-installed\fR is passed, only list those dependencies that are currently installed\.
.
.IP
By default, \fBdeps\fR shows required and recommended dependencies for \fIformulae\fR\. To include the \fB:build\fR type dependencies, pass \fB\-\-include\-build\fR\. Similarly, pass \fB\-\-include\-optional\fR to include \fB:optional\fR dependencies\. To skip \fB:recommended\fR type dependencies, pass \fB\-\-skip\-recommended\fR\.
.
.TP

Search both name and description (\fB\-s\fR), just the names (\fB\-n\fR), or just the descriptions (\fB\-d\fR) for \fB<pattern>\fR\. \fB<pattern>\fR is by default interpreted as a literal string; if flanked by slashes, it is instead interpreted as a regular expression\. Formula descriptions are cached; the cache is created on the first search, making that search slower than subsequent ones\.
.
.TP
\fBdiy\fR [\fB\-\-name=\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB\-\-version=\fR\fIversion\fR]
Automatically determine the installation prefix for non\-Homebrew software\.
.

.
.IP
If \fB\-\-cc=\fR\fIcompiler\fR is passed, attempt to compile using \fIcompiler\fR\. \fIcompiler\fR should be the name of the compiler\'s executable, for instance \fBgcc\-4\.2\fR for Apple\'s GCC 4\.2, or \fBgcc\-4\.9\fR for a Homebrew\-provided GCC 4\.9\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-build\-from\-source\fR or \fB\-s\fR is passed, compile the specified \fIformula\fR from source even if a bottle is provided\. Dependencies will still be installed from bottles if they are available\.
.
.IP
If \fBHOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\fR is set, regardless of whether \fB\-\-build\-from\-source\fR was passed, then both \fIformula\fR and the dependencies installed as part of this process are built from source even if bottles are available\.

Instantiate a Homebrew build environment\. Uses our years\-battle\-hardened Homebrew build logic to help your \fB\./configure && make && make install\fR or even your \fBgem install\fR succeed\. Especially handy if you run Homebrew in an Xcode\-only configuration since it adds tools like \fBmake\fR to your \fBPATH\fR which otherwise build\-systems would not find\.
.
.TP

.
.TP
\fBtap\fR [\fB\-\-full\fR] \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR [\fIURL\fR]
Tap a formula repository\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBtap <user>/<repo> https://github\.com/<user>/homebrew\-<repo>\fR\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.IP
By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR), but if \fB\-\-full\fR is passed, a full clone will be used\. To convert a shallow copy to a full copy, you can retap passing \fB\-\-full\fR without first untapping\.
.
.IP
\fBtap\fR is re\-runnable and exits successfully if there\'s nothing to do\. However, retapping with a different \fIURL\fR will cause an exception, so first \fBuntap\fR if you need to modify the \fIURL\fR\.
