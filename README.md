# Linuxbrew
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Linuxbrew/brew.svg)](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/releases)

[Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) is a fork of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the macOS package manager, for Linux.

It can be installed in your home directory and does not require root access. The same package manager can be used on both your Linux server and your Mac laptop. Installing a modern version of *glibc* and *gcc* in your home directory on an old distribution of Linux takes five minutes.

Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](http://linuxbrew.sh). Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is [explained here](http://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook.html#homebrew-terminology).

To receive updates of major changes to Linuxbrew subscribe to the [Linuxbrew Updates](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/issues/1) issue on GitHub.

## Install Linuxbrew

The installation script installs Linuxbrew to `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` if possible and in your home directory at `~/.linuxbrew` otherwise.

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/install/master/install)"
```

Follow the *Next steps* instructions to add Linuxbrew to your `PATH` and to your bash shell profile script, either `~/.profile` on Debian/Ubuntu or `~/.bash_profile` on CentOS/Fedora/RedHat.

```sh
test -d ~/.linuxbrew && PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
test -d /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew && PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
test -r ~/.bash_profile && echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/bin:$PATH"' >>~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/bin:$PATH"' >>~/.profile
```

You're done! Try installing a package:

```sh
brew install hello
```

If you're using an older distribution of Linux, installing your first package will also install a recent version of `gcc`.

Use `brew doctor` to troubleshoot common issues.

Features
--------

+ Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
+ Install software not packaged by the native distribution
+ Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
+ Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines

Dependencies
------------

+ **GCC** 4.4 or newer
+ **Linux** 2.6.16 or newer
+ **64-bit x86** or **32-bit ARM** (Raspberry Pi)

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

### Debian or Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl file git python-setuptools ruby
```

### Fedora, CentOS or Red Hat

```sh
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' && sudo yum install curl file git irb python-setuptools ruby
```

### 32-bit x86 platforms

Linuxbrew does not currently support 32-bit x86 platforms. It would be possible for Linuxbrew to work on 32-bit x86 platforms with some effort. Pull requests would be welcome if someone were to volunteer to maintain the 32-bit x86 support.

Bottles
-------

Bottles are Linuxbrew's precompiled binary packages. Linuxbrew bottles work on any Linux system. They do however require `glibc` 2.19 or better. On systems with an older version of `glibc`, Linuxbrew will install `glibc` the first time that you install a bottled formula. If you prefer to use the `glibc` provided by your system and build all formulas from source, add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

`export HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1`

## Alternative Installation

Extract (or `git clone`) Linuxbrew wherever you want. Use `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` if possible.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew.git ~/.linuxbrew
```

```sh
PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/info:$INFOPATH"
```

## What Packages Are Available?
1. Type `brew search` for a list.
2. Or use `brew search --desc <keyword>` to browse packages from the command line.

## More Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/tree/master/docs#readme).

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).

**If you don't read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**

## Something broke!

If a Linuxbrew formula doesn't work, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-core/issues) or, even better, submit a pull request.
